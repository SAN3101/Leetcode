//Moore Voting Algorithm, The intuition behind the Algorithm is based on the fact that if there is a majority element in an array, it will always remain in the lead, even after encountering other elements.
 
 class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
       int count=0, candidate=0;
       for(int num:nums) {
           if(count==0) {
               candidate=num;
           }
           if(num==candidate) {
               count++;
           }
           else {
               count--; 
           }
       }
       return candidate;
    }
